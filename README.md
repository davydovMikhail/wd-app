# Wallet Discover Whitepaper

## Introduction

Welcome to Wallet Discover. A unique platform for searching for forgotten wallets that unites community members. The uniqueness of the platform allows you to be a participant, while you do not need to make any contribution or block your funds. All you need is to connect your wallet to the platform. 

We combine your computing power on a voluntary basis with a fair remuneration distribution system.

Just connect your wallet to the platform and become a member of the community, which has not yet been on the Internet.

## Mission and Vision

Finding forgotten wallets is a non-trivial task. The probability of finding something is very low if you do it alone. Therefore, our project unites a large number of participants, allowing everyone to earn and increasing the overall chance of luck.

If a user uses our platform, the user presents his device to the community as computing power. The platform generates addresses from random seed phrases to check their balance in the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon networks. 

If the search result gave a positive result, then the found cryptocurrency is distributed between the one who found it and the holders of the project token. You can buy a project token, then you are guaranteed to receive the found cryptocurrency in proportion to the share that you hold of the total supply.
