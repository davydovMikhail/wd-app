# Wallet Discover Whitepaper

## Introduction

Welcome to Wallet Discover, a revolutionary platform designed to help you search for forgotten wallets while fostering a vibrant community. What sets us apart is our commitment to inclusivityâ€”participation is simple and requires no financial contributions or funds to be locked. Just connect your wallet to our platform and embark on your journey to forgotten assets!

We harness your computing power on a voluntary basis and implement a fair remuneration distribution system.

Simply connect your wallet to the platform and become part of a groundbreaking community that has yet to be seen on the Internet.

## Mission and Vision

Discovering forgotten wallets can be a challenging endeavor. The likelihood of success is significantly lower when you search alone. That's why our project brings together a vast community of participants, enhancing everyone's earning potential while boosting the overall chances of finding hidden treasures.

When a user utilizes our platform, they contribute their device's computing power to the community. The platform generates addresses from random seed phrases to check their balances across the Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon networks. 

If the search yields positive results, the discovered cryptocurrency is distributed between the finder and the holders of the project token. By purchasing a project token, you are guaranteed to receive a share of the found cryptocurrency, proportional to the amount of tokens you hold relative to the total supply.
